# What is PCPAIR?
PCPair is a website aimed at helping aspiring PC builders to buy the best components for their system (specifically CPU & GPU).

# How to Use
Step 1: Decide on a total budget for your whole PC (CPU, GPU, Motherboard, RAM, SSD, Power Supply, Case etc)
Step 2: Take your total budget from Step 1 and divide it in half. This will be your recommended amount to spend on CPU plus GPU.
Step 3: Enter the amount from Step 2 and click search.
Step 4: Look at the pairs recommended to you. These will be the most optimal combinations to get the highest FPS for this price.
Step 5: Profit??
